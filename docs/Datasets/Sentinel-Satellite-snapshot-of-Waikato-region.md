# Sentinel Satellite snapshot of Waikato region

Spanning the period 2014 through 2020, focusing on the Lake Whangape area within the Waikato region of New Zealand, images captured by the satellites; [Sentinel 1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD) and [Sentinel 2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2).
Sentinel 1 captures images from the ‘C-Band’ using VV, HH, W+VH and HH + HV polarisations. Sentinel 2 employs bands B1 through B12. Image storage is accomplished using UINT16 values in the Tiff format. Prior to storage the satellite images are orthorectified.
  
Data collected from these devices is referenced within the report ["Remote sensing of Waikato Wetlands"](https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/assets/WRC/WRC-2019/tr201621.pdf)
