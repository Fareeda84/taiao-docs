# MetOcean wave buoys

[MetOcean Solutions](https://www.metocean.co.nz/) currently has six instruments collecting wave data in the Southern Ocean, including one moored and five drifting buoys. [Here](https://www.metocean.co.nz/southern-ocean) we provide graphs showing the real-time data. Note all these data are freely available to the scientific community.
