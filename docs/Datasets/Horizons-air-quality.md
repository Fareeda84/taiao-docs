# Horizons Air Quality

Air quality data captured from the towns of [Taihape](https://taihape.co.nz/) and [Taumarunui](https://www.taumarunui.co.nz/)

One of the main sources of air pollution are airborne particles measuring less than 10 micrometres across. This dataset measures the concentration of these particles.
