May be some differences with naming. Marewa Climate and St Johns Climate are the two main sites I think (names may be slightly different). They’re the same ones providing data to LAWA. The naming conventions for the measurements may be different to Horizons, but the data format etc should be the same. I think there’s an Awatoto climate site too, but this is coastal and so can be heavily influenced by spray etc depending on the weather / sea conditions, may be useful for benchmarking / accounting for natural effects though.
