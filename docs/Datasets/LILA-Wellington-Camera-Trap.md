# LILA Wellington Camera Trap

### Overview

The following was extracted from [LILA BC:](http://lila.science/datasets/wellingtoncameratraps)

This data set contains 270,450 images from 187 camera locations in Wellington, New Zealand. The cameras (Bushnell 119537, 119476, and 119436) recorded sequences of three images when triggered. Each sequence was labelled by citizen scientists and/or professional ecologists from Victoria University of Wellington into 17 classes: 15 animal categories (for example, the most common labels are bird, cat, and hedgehog), empty, and unclassifiable. Approximately 17% of images are labeled as empty. Images within each sequence share the same species label (even though the animal may not have been recorded in all three images).
