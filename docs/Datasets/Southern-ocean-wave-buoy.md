As part of a collaboration between [New Zealand Defence Force](http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/), [Defence Technology Agency](http://www.dta.mil.nz/) and [MetOcean Solutions](https://www.metocean.co.nz/) moored and drifting buoys have been deployed in the Southern Ocean with the aim of collecting wave data. [Here](https://www.metocean.co.nz/southern-ocean) are provided graphs showing the real-time data. Some of the buoys are now no longer operational but the data they recorded remains available in archive.
