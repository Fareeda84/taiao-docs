This data set encompasses more than two-thousand one hundred, thirty-second video clips captured using Infra-red triggered Bushnell cameras. The cameras are distributed through thirty locations within the Raglan region. Data collected from the cameras are individually annotated by members of the TAIAO project through the identification, using a bounding box, of an area of interest within the stream. The bounding box is then categorised into one of seven distinct groups given the activity captured by the camera. It should be noted that approximately seventy percent of the video frames are labelled as empty. Data is labelled in accordance with the [Microsoft COCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0312) specification.

The project is tasked with the detection of predatory animals within [Mt Karioi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karioi), a part of the [Pirongia Forest Park](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/pirongia-forest-park?tab-id=50578).
