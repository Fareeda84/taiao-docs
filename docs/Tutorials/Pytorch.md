Professor Albert Bifet

* Framework for Machine Learning.
* Compare with other popular frameworks like TensorFlow.
* Consists of two main components
    * Numeric representation optimised for GPUs
    * Deep Learning framework

* Motivation
    * Deep Learning using Python accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment
    * Uses a dynamic computation graph approach
    * Uses hardware accelerators as GPUs

* Deep Learning
    * Inspired by Biological neural networks, but not the same
    * Construct improved features representing the input problem
    * Combine features to improve network predictive capability

* Neural Network
    * Example network

* PyTorch audience
    * Replacement for NumPy - using the power of GPUs
    * Deep Learning research platform providing
        * Speed
        * Flexibility

* TensorFlow
    * [Playground - https://playground.tensorflow.org](https://playground.tensorflow.org)

* Stochastic Gradient Descent
    * Strategy for updating weights ('learning')
    * Computed automatically within PyTorch

* Skorch
    * Scikit-Learn wrapper for PyTorch

* PyTorch example
    * MNIST Dataset (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
    * Classicial dataset used within Deep Learning
    * PyTorch data Loading
    * PyTorch model
    * Training & Evaluation
    * Evaluating Training Loss
    * Evaluating Testing Loss

* TensorFlow
  * Feature contrast with PyTorch
  * Static topology
  * Model building similiar to PyTorch
