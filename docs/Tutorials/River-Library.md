* Incremental learning - All the tools in river can be updated with a single sample at a time.  
* Adaptive learning - Adaptive methods are specifically designed to be robust against concept drift in dynamic environments.  
* General-purpose - [River](https://riverml.xyz/latest/) caters for different machine learning problems, including regression, classification, unsupervised learning, and
ad-hoc tasks.  
* Efficient - By design, streaming techniques efficiently handle resources such as memory and processing time, given the unbounded nature
of data streams.  
* Easy to use - River is intended for users with any experience level. As a machine learning package, it caters for practitioners as well as
researchers.  
* Expandable - River is a constantly evolving resource with new and updated tools providing additional, or improved, capabilities.
