# Explainable AI

An example of Explainable Machine Learning can be found [here](https://taiao-xml.azurewebsites.net/). This resource provides a demonstration of the capability
for Machine Learning algorithms to provide a measure of understandability given the output from the algorithm. 

 which demonstrates the ability of Machine Learning algorithms to provide guidance related to the manner in which an outcome was reached.
