MOA is the most popular open source framework for data stream mining, with a very active growing community. It includes a collection of machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems) and tools for evaluation, that are suitable for data streams, i.e. cases where one doesnâ€™t have the opportunity to re-process the data multiple times.
